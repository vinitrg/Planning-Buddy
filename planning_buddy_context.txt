PLANNING BUDDY APP - PROJECT CONTEXT
=====================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Simple planning assistant app for Product Managers based on 1-Minute Manager principles
- Connects to Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar only
- Automatically identifies what needs to be worked on using Eisenhower Matrix
- Focus on habit formation and behavior change from reactive (Q1-heavy) to strategic (Q2-focused)

CORE BEHAVIORAL FRAMEWORK:
- Current Reality: 80% Q1 (urgent/important), 20% everything else
- Target Distribution: 50% Q2, 30% Q1, 15% Q3, 5% Q4
- Success Metric: Increasing Q2 task completions
- Reward System: 20 Q2 completions = sandwich reward ðŸ¥ª

EISENHOWER MATRIX INTEGRATION:
- Q1: Urgent + Important (fires to fight)
- Q2: Important, Not Urgent (strategic work) - PRIMARY FOCUS
- Q3: Urgent, Not Important (interruptions)  
- Q4: Neither urgent nor important (busy work)

TASK MANAGEMENT:
- No artificial goal limits - track all goals equally initially
- Priority levels: Critical/High/Med/Low
- Task flagging: 2 days no progress = flagged for visibility
- Time estimation habit formation: prompt after 2-3 days
- Overdue concern: 2 days past due date

OVERWHELM DETECTION:
- Task overdue + no action taken
- No time estimate provided (requires investigation)
- Smart response: Ask why no estimate (complex/unclear/exploratory)

APP INTERACTIONS:
Weekly - Monday 11:00 AM Planning:
- Duration: 30 minutes initially, reduce to 15 minutes eventually
- Review last week's Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 distribution
- Alert if no Q2 tasks planned for new week
- Set priorities and categories for upcoming tasks
- Track progress toward ideal distribution

Daily - 10:30 AM Notification:
- Show today's priorities (simple list to start)
- Include context from week's goals
- Highlight Critical tasks
- Suggest Q2 focus when appropriate
- Post-MVP: Add conversational elements

Focus Time (12-5 PM):
- "What's the 5-minute piece?" breakdown approach
- Overwhelm intervention protocols

End of Day:
- Progress tracking and Q2 completion celebration

Weekend:
- Gentle reminders (not intrusive)

GOOGLE INTEGRATIONS:
- Google Drive: PRDs, planning docs, meeting notes (optional storage)
- Gmail: JIRA ticket number parsing, commitment tracking
- Google Calendar: Meetings, deadlines, focus time blocks

HABIT FORMATION AREAS:
- Time estimation (primary - never done currently)
- Q2 strategic work focus
- Weekly planning consistency
- 5-minute task breakdown when overwhelmed
- Additional habits to be documented separately

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- Simple list interface initially
- Pattern learning for task categorization
- Visual distribution tracking (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4)
- Celebration/reward system integration
- Conversational interface (post-MVP)

ONE-MINUTE MANAGER PRINCIPLES:
- Clear, brief goals
- Immediate feedback/celebration
- Quick course correction when overwhelmed
- Focus on one thing at a time during overwhelm

DEVELOPMENT PHASES:
MVP: Simple lists, basic categorization, Google integrations
Post-MVP: Conversational interface, advanced habit formation

CURRENT STATUS: Brainstorming and design phase complete
NEXT STEPS: Technical implementation planning
